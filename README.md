# retail-store-standalone
is a standalone retail store
 basic structure for a retail store app with sales, inventory, and stock movement automation. Here’s a high-level overview of how you might structure your application:

Python

class Product:
    def __init__(self, id, name, price, quantity):
        self.id = id
        self.name = name
        self.price = price
        self.quantity = quantity

class Inventory:
    def __init__(self):
        self.products = {}

    def add_product(self, product):
        self.products[product.id] = product

    def remove_product(self, id):
        if id in self.products:
            del self.products[id]

    def update_quantity(self, id, quantity):
        if id in self.products:
            self.products[id].quantity = quantity

class Sales:
    def __init__(self):
        self.sales = []

    def record_sale(self, product, quantity):
        self.sales.append((product, quantity))
        product.quantity -= quantity

class RetailStore:
    def __init__(self):
        self.inventory = Inventory()
        self.sales = Sales()

    def add_product_to_inventory(self, product):
        self.inventory.add_product(product)

    def sell_product(self, id, quantity):
        if id in self.inventory.products and self.inventory.products[id].quantity >= quantity:
            self.sales.record_sale(self.inventory.products[id], quantity)
        else:
            print("Product not available or insufficient quantity.")

This is a very basic structure and doesn’t include many features you’d likely need in a real-world application, such as error handling, user interfaces, databases, etc. But it should give you a good starting point. You’d also likely want to add methods for things like viewing current inventory, viewing sales records, etc.

Please note that this is a Python code and you might need to adjust it according to your preferred programming language and specific requirements. Also, remember to follow best practices for your chosen language and consider other factors such as security and performance.
